# Password_Generator

The point of this assignment is to come up with a random password, to give the user a choice between lower case and upper case letters as well as numbers and special characters depending on the choices made so for example: texas, TEXAS, TEXAS123, Texas!23, T3xA\$12. This could be used as something you can use as an actual password for a efile or account.
